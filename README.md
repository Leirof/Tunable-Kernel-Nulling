## Context

The direct detection of exoplanets is a challenging task due to the high contrast coupled to the small angle between the star and the planet. Some techniques have been developed to overcome this issue, such as coronagraphy that use an optical component, placed on a sinle telescope, that split the light and produce destructive interference to cancel the starlight. However, the coronagraphy is limited by the diffraction of the telescope and the aberrations of the optical components.

Another approach is the Nulling interferometry which consist of using several telescopes such as the phase of the starlight is perfectly synchronized. It is then possible to cancel the starlight by destructive interference and be more sensitive to the neighboring objects. However, the nulling interferometry is limited by the atmospheric turbulence that induce phase fluctuations between the telescopes.

The kernel-nulling interferometry is a new technique that enhance the nulling interferometry technique by exploiting the fact that all telescopes experiment the same atmospheric perturbations. We then creat new combination of the different signals and create kernel-nulls that cancel these perturbations and allow to be even more sensitive to the neighboring objects.
